abstract:
  Aleph is a cross-blockchain layer-2 network specifically focused on decentralized applications and their related infrastructure (storage, computing servers, security). Our aim is to decentralize and revolutionize the web and the cloud as we know it.

  Current decentralized applications are generally unreliable and slow or tied to single blockchain architecture. Decentralized applications need to not only overcome these issues, but they also need to be able to communicate with other projects. The large majority of current blockchain-related technologies cannot scale to the levels needed for large applications (social networks, web apps, IoT providers, etc) we use on a daily basis. Aleph intends to provide a solution to these issues by offering fast single cross-technologies and cross-chain solution on a decentralized and reliable ecosystem.
