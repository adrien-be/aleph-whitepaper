# Roadmap

## Genesis (NULS Only)

In the first step of the project, the token will live on the NULS blockchain as an NRC-20 token. Rewards to the nodes of the network will be given from the Aleph reserve funds.

The only address format and public keys supported on the network will be the NULS addresses.

At the start of this period, a proof of concept will be ready and applications can be developed on Aleph, supporting all but cross-chain and virtual machines.

## Cross-chain

The cross-chain infrastructure will be developed at this milestone, allowing other kind of addresses to be used on the Aleph network (Ethereum first).

## Virtual machines

The "Smart Apps" virtual machine will be developed for this milestone, allowing the Aleph native token to live in a virtual machine by itself.

A token swap will take place from the nrc-20 (and erc-20 if ever issued) token to the native token.

## Network nodes and economy

If technically possible, other chains token (aleph token as nrc-20, erc-20 or nep-5 for example) will be able to be swapped from and to the Aleph native token.

The network nodes will now receive their token rewards corresponding to the plan described in the Token chapter.

## Specialized nodes

The priorization feature will now be developed and all nodes won't store all the data or run all the VMs.
Some nodes can focus on a few dApps for their owners while still being able to help the whole network (and their dApp content can still be accessible to others).

## Future

There is a lot of possibilities for the future (not defined yet):

- Decentralized exchanges and encapsulation of other assets
- Use of Aleph as a monetary 2nd layer (like lightning or plasma)
- ...
