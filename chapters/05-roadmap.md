# Roadmap

## Genesis (NULS Only), Q1 2019 (done)

In the first step of the project, the token will live on the NULS blockchain as an NRC-20 token. Rewards to the nodes of the network will be given from the Aleph reserve funds.

The only address format and public keys supported on the network will be NULS addresses.

At the start of this period, a proof of concept will be ready and applications can be developed on Aleph, supporting all but cross-chain and virtual machines.

## Cross-chain, Q2 2019 (in progress)

The cross-chain infrastructure will be developed at this milestone, allowing other types of addresses to be used on the Aleph network (Ethereum first).

## Placeholder token issuance, Q3 2019

A placeholder token is issued as an nrc-20 token (and possibly erc-20), the POCM system starts.

## Virtual machines and Main-Net, Q4 2019

The "Smart Apps" virtual machine will be developed for this milestone, allowing the Aleph native to be minted.

A token swap will take place from the NRC-20 (and ERC-20 if issued) token to the native token.

## Aleph dApps SDK, Q4 2019

Full Aleph dApps based on Aleph virtual machines will have an SDK available, both for the virtual machine code, and JavaScript client-side code. With login using underlying chain addresses (web3, ledger wallet...).

## IoT SDK, Q1 2020

A SDK will be made available for IoT embedded devices, using MicroPython and/or Arduino-compatible code.

## Network nodes and economy, Q2 2020

If technically possible, other chains tokens (aleph token as nrc-20, erc-20 or nep-5 for example) will be able to be swapped from and to the Aleph native token.

The network nodes will now receive their token rewards corresponding to the plan described in the Token chapter.

## Underlying chains acceleration and SDK, Q3 2020

**A SDK will be made available at this milestone to easily migrate underlying chain dApps and accelerate them (Ethereum first).**

## Specialized/Hybrid nodes, Q3 2020

The priorization feature will now be developed and all nodes won't store all the data or run all the VMs.
Some nodes can focus on a few dApps for their owners while still being able to help the whole network (and their dApp content can still be accessible to others).

## Future

There are a lot of possibilities for the future (not defined yet):

- Decentralized exchanges and encapsulation of other assets
- Use of Aleph as a monetary 2nd layer (like lightning or plasma)
- ...
