# Introduction

The Internet was originally built to connect computers together. It has been used as a marvelous communication and data storage model."Add a sentence here about how the internet has morphed to blockchain as a segway and then discuss the next sentence?" Protocols originally designed for decentralization are already showing their limitations.

In a purely economically driven world; simplicity, centralization, and non-standard data models tend to win out.

What is our internet today? Silos loosely connected together, users having data in each of those silos (Facebook, Google, and many others), with no simple way to port it over. [see @kyledrake]

There are a lot of attempts at breaking those silos, from connection from silo to silo (iftt, rgpd for data request, opendata programs...), to decentralized networks of silos (mastodon). We are living in a world of data silos.

In itself, that isn't bad if those silos were easily accessible and decentralized. Users don't know it, but they need to reclaim their data.
