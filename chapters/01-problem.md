# Introduction

Internet has been built to connect computer together. It has been used as a marvelous communication and data storage model. Our protocols originally designed for decentralization are showing their limits.

In a purely economy driven world, simplicity, centralization and non-standard data models tends to win.

What is our internet today? Silos loosely connected together, users having data in each of those silos (Facebook, Google, and many others), with no simple way to port it over.

There is a lot of attempts at breaking those silos, from connection from silo to silo (iftt, rgpd for data request, opendata programs...), to decentralized networks of silos (mastodon). We are living in a world of data silos.

In itself, it isn't bad. If those silos were easily accessible, and decentralized. Users don't know it, but they need to reclaim their data.
